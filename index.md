# About

Hello, fellow nerds ðŸ‘‹. Thanks for giving my site a look!

I'm a computer science major and a racing fan, looking to enhance NR2003, one of the greatest racing sims ever developed. I'm also currently experimenting with AWS and Firebase for web development.

I also have a blog: [click here](posts) to scroll posts from the most recent.
